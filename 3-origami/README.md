# Origami Puzzle

The main point of this puzzle is to fold a piece of paper in specific ways and make a message appear.

##### Clue: We need to give hackers the puzzle pdf and somehow hint that odds are in and evens are out. We could tie these clues into a cute story like

Doge couldn't believe what he saw. There were apples falling everywhere! Even outside, far far away, doge could see them apples falling. However, doge knew he could make it through this storm and rememberd a famous line. "May the odds be ever in your favor."

###To Solve
1. Print the pdf
2. Cut the front along the borders (printers have different margins and the solution might be hard to see if you skip this)
3. With the side with the numbers facing you, go in order and fold odd lines towards you and evens away. You should end up with the answer `very wow` after 7 folds.
