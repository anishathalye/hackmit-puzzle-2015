# auth puzzle

It's pretty easy to deploy this, it's a pretty standard node/express app.

The only thing you need to remember to do is to set the `SECRET_CODE`
environment variable to `amaze algorithm`. An easy way of running the script is
`SECRET_CODE='amaze algorithm' npm start`.

## setup

When the code for this puzzle has been completed, everything in this directory
should be copied into a separate Git repo with a single commit "Initial
commit". This should be pushed to
[dogeunderground/stronghold](https://github.com/dogeunderground/stronghold).
