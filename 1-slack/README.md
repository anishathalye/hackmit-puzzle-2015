# DogeBot

A Slack bot for [dogemit.slack.com](https://dogemit.slack.com/). Talk to the bot in dogespeak and it'll respond! There's also a web app that allows you to sign yourself up for the dogemit Slack team.

## Solution
If you message dogebot `pls` in `#general`, it'll respond with `pls message direct`. This suggests that you have to direct message it. Speak to it in dogespeak in the direct message chat and it'll spit out 9 lines of dogescript code in order. The dogescript snippet logs the puzzle solution to the console.
